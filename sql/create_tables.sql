-- Start by deleting any tables if the exist already
-- We want to be able to re-run this script as needed.
-- DROP tables in reverse order of creation 
-- DROP dependent tables (with foreign keys) first

-- Create the books table
-- Note that the books table has a foreign key to the authors table
-- This means that the books table is dependent on the authors table
-- Be sure to create the standalone authors table BEFORE creating the books table.

-- Create the authors table 
-- Note that the author table has no foreign keys, so it is a standalone table
